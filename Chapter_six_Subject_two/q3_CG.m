% Solving the system of equations using the CG method (It is not clear how to introduce boundary conditions using Matlab's built-in pcg method, so we decompose the steps from the book and introduce boundary conditions individually)
% After an unsuccessful attempt, it was determined that the main factor influencing the convergence of the conjugate gradient method is the coefficient matrix, and the computation does not yet involve the numerical relationship between one coordinate and neighboring coordinates.
% Therefore, the information from the boundary conditions cannot be incorporated into the conjugate gradient method for now.
